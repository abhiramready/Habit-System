## January
- Started working on the project 25+5 Cock in the FreeCodeCamp frontend certification
- For building the 25+5 Clock faced challenges with starting and stopping the timer with setInterval() and getInterval()
- Started learning/revising HTML basics, documenting my learning with links to posts, videos, and notes in this repository [XT HTML](https://github.com/abhiramready/XT-HTML)

## February
- While learning HTML, covered SEO, W3C standards, Accessibility, Atomic Design, and more
- Wrapped up learning [HTML](https://github.com/abhiramready/XT-HTML) for the current level, next up CSS
- Short break, focusing on work and other things

## March
Little progress made - I am planning to get three things done, one by one

FreeCodeCamp Final Project: to get the Front End Libraries Certification, I have finished all the required steps, and this is the last project, but facing some resistance with the whole timer thing for the 25+5 clock. I need to commit to fixing the issue before moving forward.

Write Blogs: It has been a few months since I published on matrixread (my dev blog). I have been learning a thing or two and start writing again.

Learn CSS Fundamentals: as part of my learning plan, I have wrapped up the HTML fundamentals in a streak, and next, we have CSS and then the JS part. Anyway, Iâ€™d like to start with this going forward, followed by other activities.
