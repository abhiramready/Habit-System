## Learn Programming 2022 üßë‚Äçüíª

## January

- Started working on the project 25+5 Cock in the FreeCodeCamp frontend certification, few sections left
- For building the 25+5 Clock faced challenges with starting and stopping the timer with setInterval() and getInterval()
- Started learning/revising HTML basics, documenting my learning with links to posts, videos, and notes in this repository [XT HTML](https://github.com/abhiramready/XT-HTML)

## February

- While learning HTML covered SEO, W3C standards, Accessibility, Atomic Design, and more
- Wrapped up learning [HTML](https://github.com/abhiramready/XT-HTML) for the current level, next up CSS
- Short break, focusing on work and other things

## March

Little progress made - I am planning to get 3 things done, one by one

FreeCodeCamp Final Project: to get the Front End Libraries Certification, I have finished all the required steps and this is the last project but facing some resistance with the whole timer thing for the 25+5 clock, will need to commit and fix the issue to progress forward

Write Blogs: its been a few months since I‚Äôve published on matrixread (my dev blog), as I have been learning a thing or two, I wish to start writing again.

Learn CSS Fundamentals: as part of my learning plan I have wrapped up the HTML fundamentals in a streak and next we have CSS and later the JS part. Anyways I‚Äôd like to start with this going forwards, then other activities.
