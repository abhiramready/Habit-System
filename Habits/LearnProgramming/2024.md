## November
### [Front End Interviews](https://www.greatfrontend.com/front-end-interview-guidebook) - Notes and Overview

### Resume Preparation
- Prepare a resume tailored to the job posting including the keywords in the posting
- Format resume, keep it simple, single page, relevant technologies and suitable to the job

### Coding Questions
- Get familiar with working on IDE and Notepad in some cases
- Types of coding questions: Algorithmic, JS, UI, System Design Questions, Quiz Questions, Behavioral Questions
- Make your self-introduction in under a minute. Unless requested, do not take longer than this otherwise you might not have enough time to code.

### Guidelines for Evaluating Coding Interviews
> - **Problem Solving**: Use a systematic and logical approach to understanding and addressing a problem. Break down the problem into smaller independent issues. Evaluate different approaches and their tradeoffs.
> - **Software Engineering Foundation**: Familiarity with data structures, algorithms, runtime complexity analysis, use of design patterns, and designing solutions with clean abstractions.
> - **Technical Competence:** Ability to translate solutions into working code and demonstrate a strong understanding of the language.
> - **Domain Expertise**: Understanding the front-end domain and the relevant languages: Browser (DOM and DOM APIs), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, User Experience, Accessibility, i18n, Networks, and Performance.
> - **Communication**: Ask questions to clarify details and clearly explain one's approach and considerations.
> - **Verification**: Identify various scenarios to test the code against, including edge cases. Be able to diagnose and fix any issues that arise.

### Algorithmic Questions
- Efficiency of the code (time and space complexity) is important
- Leetcode questions, not specific to Frontend, impractical, and not real-life e.g flipping a binary tree
- Combine studying and practicing for a single topic

> Although algorithmic coding questions aren't specific to the front end, the skills needed to excel in these questions — strong analytical thinking, effective communication, a solid grasp of the common data structures and algorithms, and good code hygiene, are still crucial skills good Front End Engineers should possess. Good Front End Engineers are also good Software Engineers and good Software Engineers should have mastery over basic DSA. Hence it's no surprise that many companies still ask algorithmic coding questions during the interview process. Familiarity with data structures and algorithms is also helpful for solving JavaScript coding questions and User Interface coding questions.

**Example Questions**
- Reverse a linked list.
- Determine if a string contains balanced brackets.
- Determine how many substrings in a string are palindromes.

> Building the basic accordion component might let you pass the interview, but nailing the accessibility aspects will help you score more points and possibly put you at senior level.

### Coding Round Cheatsheet
> **Break down the problem**: Break down the problem into stages/milestones that build on top of each other and write your code progressively.
>
> **Test frequently**: Test the UI in the browser after you complete every feature so that you can catch bugs early. Bugs caught earlier are easier to fix. Make sure the current feature is working before moving on to the next feature.
>
> **Use JavaScript frameworks if possible**: Your life will be very hard if you choose to build a complicated UI using Vanilla JavaScript as the code can get very long and messy quickly. We recommend building apps and games using a framework if possible.
>
> **Think ahead and plan accordingly**: Think about what features your interviewer might ask you to add next. Design your code in a way that makes it easy for new features to be added.
>
>  **Component Organization**: Separate components into an outer one that provides the data and an inner stateless one that renders the view based on the data.

### State Mangement in UI
> **State is data that changes over time in your UI, commonly due to user interactions or background events (network request response, passing of time, WebSocket events).**
>
> Identify essential state vs derived state. A derived state is a state that can be calculated from the essential state.
>
> Learn to use useReducer

### Network
- Prevent duplicate requests: Buttons should be disabled after submission to avoid making duplicate network requests.
- Consolidating requests: If the UI is making too many network requests, you can:
- Debounce/throttle: Rate limit the number of network requests fired.
- Batch requests: Group requests together and make only one single request. This requires the server side to support such a format.
- Optimistic UI Updates

### a11y
Handling accessibility in UI is a huge plus and in some cases a requirement for senior engineers.

    Can you use the UI with the keyboard only?
    Can you use your UI component with a screen reader?
    Can your UI component work without color?
    Can your UI component work without sound?

- Add the right aria-roles for custom-built elements not built using custom HTML tags.
- Use aria-labels to describe elements where text is not shown (e.g. icon-only buttons).

### Edge cases
> There's probably not enough time to handle all edge case scenarios in your code during the interview, but it'd be good to mention them to the interviewer for brownie points.
> Handle long strings
> Empty states
> Too many items in a list - pagination, tables.rows, word-break
