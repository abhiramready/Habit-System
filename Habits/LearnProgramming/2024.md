### [Front End Interviews](https://www.greatfrontend.com/front-end-interview-guidebook) - Definitive Overview and Preparation Guide

### Resume Preperation
- Prepare a resume tailored to the job posting includin the keywords in posting
- Format resume, keep it simple, single page, relevant technologies and suitable to the job

### Coding Questions
- Get familiar with working on IDE and notepad in some cases
- Types of coding questions: Algorithmic, JS, UI, System Design Questions, Quiz Questions, Behavioral Questions

### Algorithmic Coding
- Efficiency of the code (time and space complexity) is important
- Leetcode questions, not specific to frontend, impractical and not real-life e.g flippinf a binray tree
- Combine studying and practicing for a single topic

> Although algorithmic coding questions aren't specific to front end, the skills needed to excel in these questions — strong analytical thinking, effective communication, a solid grasp of the common data structures and algorithms, good code hygiene, are still crucial skills good Front End Engineers should possess. Good Front End Engineers are also good Software Engineers and good Software Engineers should have mastery over basic DSA. Hence it's no surprise that many companies still ask algorithmic coding questions during the interview process. Familiarity with data structures and algorithms is also helpful for solving JavaScript coding questions and User Interface coding questions.

> ### Algorithmic Coding Interview Rubrics
> During algorithmic coding interviews, interviewers are evaluating candidates on the following skills:
> - Problem Solving: Use a systematic and logical approach to understanding and addressing a problem. Break down the problem into smaller independent problems. Evaluate different approaches and their tradeoffs.
> - Technical Competence: Ability to translate solutions into working code and demonstrating a strong understanding of the language being used.
> - Communication: Ask questions to clarify details and clearly explain one's approach and considerations.
> - Verification: Identify various scenarios to test the code against, including edge cases. Be able to diagnose and fix any issues that arise.
