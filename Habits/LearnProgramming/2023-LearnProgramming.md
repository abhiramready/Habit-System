### Learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs)
Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering:  

Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. The difference is in when it generates the HTML for a page.
- SSG Static Generation is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request.
- SSR Server-side Rendering is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on each request.

#### Client-side Rendering in Next.js
- When the page loads, fetch external data from the client using JavaScript and populate the remaining parts.
- This approach works well for user dashboard pages, for example. Because a dashboard is a private, user-specific page, SEO is not relevant, and the page doesn‚Äôt need to be pre-rendered. The data is frequently updated, which requires request-time data fetching.

#### Server-side Rendering
```javascript
// context contains request-specific parameters.
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      // props for your component
    },
  };
}
```
